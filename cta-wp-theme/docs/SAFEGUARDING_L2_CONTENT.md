## Main Content (900+ words)

Safeguarding is one of the most critical responsibilities in care work. This Level 2 Safeguarding course provides essential training for all care workers in Kent, covering the recognition, prevention, and reporting of abuse for both vulnerable adults and children. Whether you work in a care home, domiciliary care, or supported living, this course ensures you meet CQC requirements and understand your legal duty to protect those in your care.

### Why Safeguarding Training Matters

Every care worker in the UK has a legal duty to safeguard vulnerable people. The Care Act 2014 and the Care Quality Commission's Fundamental Standards make safeguarding training mandatory for all health and social care staff. CQC inspectors specifically check:

- That all staff have received safeguarding training appropriate to their role
- Staff can recognise different types of abuse
- Clear reporting procedures are in place and understood
- The organisation has a robust safeguarding policy

Without proper safeguarding training, care settings risk:
- CQC compliance failures
- Inadequate rating
- Legal action
- Most importantly: service users being left vulnerable to harm

This course ensures you have the knowledge and confidence to identify signs of abuse and take appropriate action to protect the people you support.

### Who Should Attend

This course is essential for:

**Care Workers** working in care homes, nursing homes, supported living, or domiciliary care providing direct support to adults or children.

**Support Workers** assisting people with daily living activities, personal care, or specialist support needs.

**New Starters** beginning their career in health and social care who need foundational safeguarding knowledge.

**Existing Staff** requiring refresher training (recommended every 1-2 years to stay current with legislation and best practice).

**Managers and Supervisors** who need to understand their additional responsibilities around safeguarding, including investigating concerns and liaising with local authorities.

This is a mandatory course for Care Certificate completion and is often requested during CQC inspections.

### What's Covered in Detail

**Types of Abuse**
Understand the six main categories of abuse: physical, emotional, sexual, neglect, financial, and discriminatory. Learn to recognise subtle signs and indicators that might suggest abuse is occurring.

**Recognising Signs of Abuse**
Practical guidance on identifying physical indicators (unexplained injuries, poor hygiene, malnutrition), behavioural changes (withdrawal, fear, aggression), and environmental factors that may suggest abuse.

**Safeguarding Procedures**
Your legal duty to report concerns, who to report to (manager, local authority safeguarding team, CQC), and what happens after you raise a concern. Understanding the difference between safeguarding concerns and alerts.

**Protecting Vulnerable Adults**
Specific considerations when working with adults who lack mental capacity, including the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and how this relates to safeguarding. Understanding consent and when to override it in the person's best interests.

**Child Safeguarding**
Recognising abuse in children and young people, understanding different thresholds for concern, and knowing when to involve children's social care services.

**Whistleblowing**
Your protected right to report poor practice or abuse, even if it implicates your employer. Understanding the Public Interest Disclosure Act and how whistleblowing policies work.

**Reducing Risks**
How good care practice reduces the likelihood of abuse. Person-centred approaches, maintaining dignity and respect, proper record-keeping, and creating open cultures where concerns can be raised safely.

**Legal Framework**
Overview of the Care Act 2014, Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards, and how these laws protect vulnerable people.

### CQC Inspection Evidence

During CQC inspections, inspectors will ask:
- "Have all staff received safeguarding training?"
- "Can staff describe different types of abuse?"
- "Do staff know who to report concerns to?"

This course ensures you can confidently answer these questions and provide certificate evidence of training. We provide training records suitable for CQC inspection documentation, including date of training, content covered, and certification details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How often do I need safeguarding training?**
CQC and most care providers require safeguarding refresher training every 1-2 years. New staff should complete safeguarding training during their induction period, ideally within the first few weeks of employment.

**Is this course CQC compliant?**
Yes. This Level 2 Safeguarding course meets CQC requirements for mandatory safeguarding training. It covers all six types of abuse and reporting procedures as required by the Care Act 2014.

**What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 safeguarding?**
Level 1 is basic awareness suitable for volunteers or those with minimal contact with vulnerable people. Level 2 is for care workers with direct responsibility for supporting adults or children - this is the level required by most care employers and CQC.

**Does this cover children as well as adults?**
Yes. This course covers safeguarding for both vulnerable adults and children, making it suitable for care workers in settings that support young people or mixed-age service users.

**What happens if I report a safeguarding concern?**
Your manager or safeguarding lead will investigate and may need to report to the local authority safeguarding team. You'll be asked to provide details of what you've observed or been told. Your identity is protected throughout the process.

**Can I do safeguarding training online?**
While some basic awareness can be learned online, CQC and most employers require face-to-face safeguarding training for care workers due to the importance of discussion, scenario work, and asking questions. Our half-day course provides this interactive element.

**Will I learn about the Mental Capacity Act?**
Yes, we cover how the Mental Capacity Act relates to safeguarding, particularly when making decisions about reporting concerns for people who lack capacity to consent.

**Is this suitable for managers?**
Yes, though managers with investigation responsibilities may also need Level 3 safeguarding training for their enhanced role. This Level 2 course provides the foundation all care staff need, including managers.
