## Article 1: What CQC Inspectors Look for in Training Records

**Meta Title:** What CQC Inspectors Look for in Training Records | CTA  
**Meta Description:** CQC training compliance checklist. Learn what inspectors examine during care quality inspections.  
**Keywords:** CQC training records, CQC inspection, mandatory training, care compliance  
**Word Count:** 1,800 words

### Introduction

Imagine this: A CQC inspection notice lands on your desk. Your team is energised, your care standards are high, and then the inspector asks to see your training records. Some staff certificates are expired. Others are missing entirely. The inspector's pen hovers over a form, and suddenly you realise you're at risk of compliance findings.

**This doesn't have to happen.**

CQC inspectors are systematic. They follow a checklist. Understanding what they're looking for—and preparing evidence in advance—turns a potential weakness into a strength. In this article, we'll walk through exactly what CQC examines during training record reviews, and how to prepare.

---

### What CQC Inspects (The Framework)

CQC's Inspection Framework examines five key areas, and training features in all of them:

1. **Safe** – Staff competence through mandatory training
2. **Effective** – Staff capability to deliver quality care
3. **Caring** – Staff understanding of person-centred approaches (built through training)
4. **Responsive** – Specialist training for diverse needs
5. **Well-Led** – Management oversight of training compliance

During a visit, inspectors review:

- **Mandatory training records** – Which staff have completed what, and when certificates expire
- **Competency assessments** – Evidence that training translated into real competence
- **Induction records** – How quickly new starters are trained
- **Refresher schedules** – How compliance is planned and tracked
- **Specialist training** – Role-specific courses (medication, safeguarding advanced, dementia)
- **Training policy** – Whether your written policy matches your actual practice

---

### The Mandatory Training Checklist

CQC explicitly expects all care workers to have completed:

**Core mandatory training (all staff):**
- Health and Safety Awareness
- Infection Prevention and Control
- Fire Safety
- Moving and Handling
- Safeguarding Adults
- Learning Disability and Autism Awareness (Oliver McGowan—legally mandated since July 2022)
- Safeguarding Children (if relevant to role)

**Additional mandatory (depending on role):**
- Medication Competency (if administering medications)
- Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty (for assessed roles)
- Equality and Diversity
- Confidentiality and GDPR

**The inspection question:** "Can you show me evidence that all your care workers have completed mandatory training appropriate to their role?"

If you say yes, inspectors will spot-check:
- 3–5 staff member files at random
- Certificates and attendance records
- Dates of completion and expiry
- Evidence of refresher training

---

### What Inspectors Look for (Specifics)

#### 1. Certificate Validity
- **The check:** Are certificates current, or have they expired?
- **Red flag:** Expired Fire Safety, safeguarding, or H&S certificates with staff still working
- **What CQC thinks:** "This staff member is no longer deemed competent. This is a compliance breach."
- **How to prepare:** Create a training renewal tracker showing expiry dates and planned refresh dates 12 months out

#### 2. Competency Beyond the Certificate
- **The question:** "How do you know they can *actually* do this?"
- **What inspectors seek:** Competency assessments, skill assessments, observed practice records
- **Red flag:** "We did the online training" with no practical assessment
- **Why it matters:** CQC knows online modules don't build muscle memory. Inspectors want evidence of *capability*, not just attendance
- **How to prepare:** Maintain supervision records showing you've observed/assessed competence, especially for high-risk areas (medication, moving & handling, safeguarding)

#### 3. Role-Appropriate Training
- **The question:** "Is each person trained for their actual role?"
- **Example gaps:** A team leader without advanced safeguarding, a medication administrator without competency assessment, a manager without leadership training
- **How to prepare:** Use a role-based training matrix. Show that trainee A (care assistant) has core training + medication awareness, while trainee B (team leader) has core training + medication competency + advanced safeguarding + moving & handling trainer status

#### 4. Induction Completion
- **The question:** "How quickly are new starters trained to competence?"
- **CQC expectation:** Mandatory training completed within first 4–8 weeks, depending on role
- **Red flag:** New staff rostered for unsupervised duties without completed induction training
- **How to prepare:** Create an induction checklist. Evidence completion dates. Show that new starters shadow more experienced staff until full competency

#### 5. Refresher Training Proof
- **The question:** "How do you manage renewal of expired certificates?"
- **CQC expectation:** A planned calendar showing when training is due, courses booked in advance
- **Red flag:** Discovering expired training *during* inspection
- **How to prepare:** Build an annual training calendar. Book refreshers 2–3 months in advance. Show inspectors your plan (not reactive scrambling)

#### 6. Training Tailored to Your Service
- **The question:** "Is training customised to *your* policies and environment?"
- **Example:** A residential care home's moving & handling course should include their specific equipment, their resident dependency levels, their policies
- **Red flag:** Generic online courses with no reference to your service, your residents, or your policies
- **How to prepare:** Work with trainers who understand your setting. Ask for tailored on-site training. Request scenario-based learning using your equipment and processes

#### 7. Management Oversight
- **The question:** "Who's accountable for training compliance?"
- **CQC expectation:** A named manager responsible for tracking, planning, and reviewing training
- **What they examine:** Board-level or senior leadership awareness of training gaps and compliance risks
- **How to prepare:** Designate a training lead. Provide them with a tracking spreadsheet. Include training compliance in management meeting agendas. Show CQC your oversight system

---

### Red Flags CQC Identifies (Avoid These)

1. **Expired certificates still in service** – Immediate compliance concern
2. **No competency assessment** – Especially for medication, moving & handling, safeguarding
3. **No induction records** – Shows new starters may not be trained before independent practice
4. **One-off training from years ago** – No evidence of refreshers or ongoing development
5. **Generic training records** – "All staff completed Fire Safety" with no individual certificates
6. **No evidence linking training to safer care** – CQC wants to see *improved* incident rates, complaints, outcomes after training investment
7. **Trainer qualifications not verified** – Especially for specialist courses; CQC asks, "Who trained them?"
8. **No training policy or records system** – Shows lack of organisational structure

---

### How to Prepare Your Evidence Now

**If you have an inspection notice, move fast:**

1. **Audit your training records** (1 day)
   - Print staff list with roles
   - Check certificate validity against each person
   - Flag expired training, missing training, or overdue refreshers
   - Create a simple spreadsheet: Staff name | Role | Mandatory courses | Expiry dates | Action needed

2. **Close critical gaps** (2–3 weeks)
   - Book urgent refreshers for expired training
   - Arrange competency assessments for key roles
   - Collect supervision/observation records showing competence

3. **Organize evidence** (3–5 days)
   - Create a training file per staff member
   - Include: certificates, competency assessments, induction records, supervision notes
   - Make it inspector-friendly (clear labels, chronological order)
   - Digital + physical copies in one place

4. **Develop your systems** (2 weeks before inspection)
   - Create a training matrix showing role-based expectations
   - Build an annual training calendar with planned refreshers
   - Write/review your training policy
   - Hold a management meeting to confirm accountability and oversight

**If you don't have a notice, build systems now:**

- Annual training audit (January)
- Quarterly refresher bookings (avoid December scrambles)
- Monthly manager checks on expiry dates
- Training as a standing agenda item in staff meetings

---

### What Good Evidence Looks Like

**CQC-ready training records include:**

✅ Staff member name, role, start date  
✅ Certificate for each mandatory course + expiry date  
✅ Competency assessment or supervisor observation (dated)  
✅ Refresher course booked before expiry  
✅ Induction checklist with completion dates  
✅ Role-based training matrix (showing what's complete vs. planned)  
✅ Training policy (written, dated, followed)  
✅ Named manager responsible for training oversight  

**When an inspector asks to see evidence:**
- You hand them a folder or digital file
- Each staff member's records are clear, complete, and current
- Refresher training is planned (not overdue)
- There's evidence of competency beyond the certificate
- Your policy matches your practice

**The inspector writes:** "Staff are appropriately trained and assessed as competent for their role."

---

### The Real Impact

Training isn't bureaucracy. It's the foundation of safe, effective care. When inspectors see solid training evidence, they see:
- Managers who prioritise safety
- Staff who are confident and competent
- A culture of continuous learning
- Lower risk of incidents, complaints, or harm

---

### Conclusion: Start Today

CQC inspections feel daunting, but they follow a clear checklist. Training records are systematic to review if you've prepared. Don't wait for an inspection notice to get your house in order. Build your systems now:

## Article 2: Care Certificate Classroom vs Online: Which is Better?

**Meta Title:** Care Certificate Classroom vs Online: Which Format is Best? | CTA  
**Meta Description:** Compare classroom and online Care Certificate training. Which delivers better competence?  
**Keywords:** Care Certificate, classroom training, online training, care worker qualification  
**Word Count:** 1,600 words

### Introduction

Your team needs Care Certificate training. You've found two options:

**Option A:** Classroom-based, 10 days in-person, Maidstone, cost £150/person.

**Option B:** Online, self-paced, 6–8 weeks, cost £80/person.

Which is right for your staff?

The answer depends on what you actually need: a certificate hanging on the wall, or a capable, confident care worker. In this article, we'll compare both formats honestly—including their trade-offs.

---

### What is the Care Certificate?

Before comparing formats, let's be clear: The Care Certificate is a national qualification covering 15 standards of good adult social care practice. It's not legally mandatory, but it's the industry standard, hugely respected by CQC, employers, and Skills for Care.

**It includes:**
- Person-centred care, communication, privacy, dignity
- Safeguarding, health & safety, infection control
- Understanding dementia, mental health, learning disabilities
- Medication awareness, moving & handling, end-of-life care

**Who needs it?** New care workers, those without formal qualifications, and anyone building a career in care.

---

### Classroom-Based Care Certificate

#### What You Get

**Format:**
- 10 consecutive days (or 5 days + evening sessions)
- Trainer-led, in a classroom or training venue
- Mix of presentations, group discussions, role-play, practical scenarios
- Assessor-facilitated learning activities
- Immediate feedback and support

**Learning experience:**
- Interaction with trainer and peers
- Real-time questions answered
- Scenario-based practice (e.g., role-play difficult conversations)
- Hands-on practice (e.g., moving & handling with equipment)
- Structured, guided pace

#### Strengths

✅ **Real human interaction** – Trainer sees how you learn, can clarify on the spot  
✅ **Accountability** – Fixed schedule, you show up and commit  
✅ **Peer learning** – Learn from and with other care workers  
✅ **Practical skills** – Moving & handling, manual techniques taught properly  
✅ **Confidence building** – Face-to-face reassurance, real equipment, real practice  
✅ **Faster completion** – 10 days vs. 6–8 weeks dragging on  
✅ **Immersion** – You're fully focused on learning, not juggling work/study  

#### Challenges

❌ **Cost of time** – 10 days away from work (cover needed, wages paid)  
❌ **Scheduling inflexibility** – Fixed dates, may not suit shift patterns  
❌ **Travel** – If training isn't on-site, cost and time for commute  
❌ **Upfront commitment** – 10 days feels daunting for some learners  
❌ **Group pace** – May be too fast for slower learners, too slow for faster ones  

#### Who It Suits Best

- **Full-time staff** able to take 2 weeks off
- **New starters** needing fast induction
- **Learners who thrive in social environments**
- **Roles requiring immediate practical competence** (e.g., domiciliary care, moving & handling)
- **Services prioritising speed** (new staff ready to work within 3 weeks)

---

### Online Care Certificate

#### What You Get

**Format:**
- Self-paced, access for 6–8 weeks (or longer)
- Video lessons, reading materials, quizzes
- Online assessor feedback
- Flexibility to study evenings/weekends
- Often includes printable workbooks

**Learning experience:**
- You control the pace and timing
- Study at your convenience
- No commute, no scheduling conflicts
- Mix of multimedia content
- Less interactive, more individual

#### Strengths

✅ **Flexibility** – Study whenever, wherever (home, lunch breaks, etc.)  
✅ **Lower cost** – Often £50–80 vs. £150 classroom  
✅ **No travel** – Access from anywhere  
✅ **Self-paced** – Slow learners can repeat, fast learners can skip ahead  
✅ **Good for theory** – Dementia, safeguarding, communication can be understood via video  
✅ **Accessible** – For staff with caring responsibilities, shift workers, or those in remote areas  

#### Challenges

❌ **No practical skills** – Can't learn moving & handling or First Aid virtually  
❌ **Low completion rates** – 40–50% of online learners don't finish  
❌ **Motivation risk** – Without structure, learning can drift  
❌ **Limited interaction** – Questions answered via email, not live  
❌ **Competency gaps** – Final assessment is often multiple-choice, not practical observation  
❌ **Takes longer** – Even if paced faster, learners often procrastinate across 8 weeks  

#### Who It Suits Best

- **Busy shift workers** with unpredictable schedules
- **Motivated, self-directed learners**
- **Staff in remote locations** without access to classroom training
- **Roles with lower practical skill demands** (e.g., admin, commissioning, some community roles)
- **Services on very tight budgets**

---

### The Honest Comparison

| Factor | Classroom | Online |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Cost (per person)** | £120–200 | £60–100 |
| **Time to complete** | 10 days | 6–8 weeks (often extends) |
| **Practical skills** | Taught and practised | Not covered |
| **Competency confidence** | High (assessed in practice) | Moderate (quiz-based) |
| **Completion rate** | 90%+ | 50–60% |
| **Best for theory** | Good (lecture-based) | Good (multimedia) |
| **Flexibility** | Low | High |
| **Peer interaction** | Yes (energising) | Minimal |
| **Assessor feedback** | Live and immediate | Delayed (email/dashboard) |
| **CQC alignment** | Excellent (hands-on) | Good (content-focused) |

---

### What CQC Prefers (And Why It Matters)

CQC inspectors ask: "Can your staff actually do this?"

For practical courses (moving & handling, safeguarding scenarios, person-centred communication), **classroom training wins**. Inspectors want to see observation records showing the trainer assessed competence *in practice*, not just online quizzes.

However, for theory-heavy modules (dementia awareness, GDPR, understanding mental capacity), **online works fine** if complemented by practical workplace learning.

**CQC Reality:** They don't mandate classroom training, but they do expect *evidence of competence*. Classroom training naturally generates this evidence (trainer observation notes, signed-off assessments). Online training requires extra work (supervision, practical assessment) to meet CQC's expectations.

---

### The Hybrid Approach (Best Practice)

Many forward-thinking care providers use a **blended model:**

1. **Online component** (2–3 weeks)
   - Theory modules: Dementia, mental health, communication, GDPR, safeguarding intro
   - Staff learn in their own time
   - Foundation knowledge builds

2. **Classroom component** (5 days)
   - Practical skills: Moving & handling, First Aid, medication handling
   - Assessment and competency sign-off
   - Scenario-based learning
   - Trainer observes and gives feedback

3. **Workplace learning** (ongoing)
   - Shadowing experienced staff
   - Supervised practice
   - Peer learning
   - On-the-job assessment

**Total time:** ~6 weeks (vs. 10 days classroom or 8 weeks online alone)  
**Cost:** ~£120 per person (cheaper than classroom alone, more thorough than online)  
**CQC readiness:** Excellent (combines theory, practical, and supervised competency)

---

### Making Your Decision

**Choose classroom if:**
- You need staff competent and working *fast* (within 3 weeks)
- Your team can commit 2 weeks
- You're prioritising practical confidence (moving & handling, scenario response)
- You want high completion rates and engagement
- CQC readiness is urgent

**Choose online if:**
- Staff have unpredictable schedules (shift work, part-time, on-call)
- Budget is very tight
- You have support systems in place to verify practical competence later (supervision, workplace assessment)
- Staff are self-motivated and independent learners
- Theory is the priority

**Choose hybrid if:**
- You want best of both worlds
- You have time flexibility but need competence assurance
- You're building a sustainable, long-term training system
- CQC is on your radar (they prefer this approach)

---

### Continuity Training Academy's Approach

At CTA, we deliver **classroom Care Certificate training** because:
- Your team learns in real-world scenarios
- Moving & handling is taught with your equipment
- Assessor observes and signs off competence
- Peer learning accelerates confidence
- You can combine with your policies (tailored on-site delivery)

We can also **recommend online providers** for theoretical top-up if you prefer a blended approach.

**Our philosophy:** Care isn't learned from a screen. It's learned by doing, practicing, receiving feedback, and building muscle memory. Classroom training with experienced trainers achieves this. Online modules are useful for theory, but they're not a complete solution.

---

### Conclusion: It's Not About the Format, It's About Competence

The "best" Care Certificate format is the one that leaves your staff **confident, competent, and ready to deliver great care**.

- **Classroom training** achieves this faster and generates CQC-ready evidence
- **Online training** offers flexibility but requires supplementary practical learning
- **Hybrid approaches** offer both flexibility and competence assurance

Whatever you choose, ask yourself: "After this training, can my staff *actually* communicate with someone with dementia? Can they move a person safely? Can they respond to safeguarding concerns?"

If the answer is yes, the training worked—regardless of format.

## Article 3: Understanding the Workforce Development Fund (WDF) and New LDSS

**Meta Title:** WDF vs LDSS: Funding Your Care Training in 2025–26 | CTA  
**Meta Description:** Understand Workforce Development Fund changes. How to access LDSS grants for care staff training.  
**Keywords:** Workforce Development Fund, LDSS, care training funding, Skills for Care  
**Word Count:** 1,700 words

### Introduction

If you manage training budgets for a care provider, you've heard it: "We need to use our Workforce Development Fund before it runs out."

Then, in 2025, the rules changed. The **WDF was replaced by the Adult Social Care Learning and Development Support Scheme (LDSS)**, and suddenly care managers and HR teams were scrambling to understand:

- What's eligible?
- How much can we claim back?
- What's the process?
- Has anything actually changed?

This article cuts through the confusion. We'll explain the shift from WDF to LDSS, how to access funding, and—most importantly—which courses are eligible so you can maximise your training budget.

---

### The Shift: What Happened to WDF?

#### WDF (Workforce Development Fund) – The Old System

For years, **WDF** was the primary funding stream for adult social care training in England. It worked like this:

- Care providers registered with CQC could claim funding
- Funds were allocated based on staff numbers and payroll costs
- Eligible courses ranged from statutory/mandatory training to leadership qualifications
- Reimbursement covered courses up to a set maximum (e.g., £55 for CQC inspection prep)
- Providers had to evidence training completion and apply for reimbursement quarterly

**The problem?** Funding was insufficient, complex to claim, and didn't keep pace with training needs. Care providers complained about bureaucracy and limited eligibility.

#### LDSS (Adult Social Care Learning and Development Support Scheme) – The New System

From **April 2025**, WDF transitioned to **LDSS**, a new government scheme with:

- **Clearer eligibility:** Specific list of approved courses and awarding organisations
- **Higher reimbursement:** Some courses increased (e.g., Oliver McGowan Tier 2 now £90, up from WDF limits)
- **Simpler claims:** Online claims portal (instead of quarterly manual submissions)
- **More courses included:** Extended list of specialist qualifications
- **Same scope:** Still covers mandatory, statutory, and development training for care staff

---

### What Changed (And What Stayed the Same)

| Aspect | WDF | LDSS |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Government funding?** | Yes | Yes |
| **Who can claim?** | CQC-registered care providers | CQC-registered care providers |
| **How much funding?** | Based on staff numbers/payroll | Same allocation model (for now) |
| **Process** | Manual quarterly claims | Online claims portal |
| **Eligible courses** | Broad (many providers) | Defined list (see below) |
| **Leadership courses** | Limited | Expanded (Skills for Care licensed programmes) |
| **Oliver McGowan training** | Tier 1 £12.50, Tier 2 £50 | Tier 1 £25, Tier 2 £90 |
| **Reimbursement timeframe** | 6–8 weeks | 4–6 weeks (potentially) |

**Bottom line:** LDSS is **better funded and clearer** than WDF, but you have to use eligible courses.

---

### Who Can Claim LDSS Funding?

**Eligible organisations:**
- Adult social care providers registered with CQC
- Includes: residential care homes, domiciliary care, supported living, nursing homes, community services
- Must be registered before the course start date

**Eligible staff:**
- Care workers, senior care workers, team leaders, registered managers, clinical staff
- Anyone on the care payroll (employed or directly commissioned)

**Not eligible:**
- Private pay, self-funded care (outside CQC registration)
- Providers not registered with CQC
- Agency staff (unless employed directly)

---

### LDSS Eligible Courses & Maximum Reimbursement (2025–26)

This is crucial: **Only courses on the approved LDSS list attract funding.** Here's what's covered:

#### Mandatory/Statutory Training (Tier 1 – Foundation)

### Courses NOT Covered by LDSS

Importantly, **LDSS does not fund:**
- First Aid training (EFAW, Paediatric)
- Health & Safety awareness (general)
- Moving & Handling
- Safeguarding awareness/training
- Medication awareness
- Fire safety
- Infection control
- Manual handling trainer courses
- CPD-only (non-accredited) courses
- In-house bespoke training without accreditation

**However:** These courses are still **mandatory** and essential for CQC compliance. You'll need to fund them from your operational budget.

---

### How LDSS Claims Work (Step-by-Step)

#### 1. Check Eligibility (Before booking)

- Is your organisation CQC-registered?
- Is the course on the LDSS approved list?
- Is the awarding organisation approved? (e.g., NCFE CACHE, TQUK, iCQ, Skills for Care)

**Pro tip:** Email us before booking. We'll confirm if your course is eligible.

#### 2. Book the Course

- Pay upfront (full cost)
- Get invoice and attendance records
- Staff complete the course and receive certificates

#### 3. Claim Reimbursement (Online Portal)

- Register on the LDSS online claims portal (gov.uk)
- Upload invoices, attendance records, and certificates
- Submit your claim (with staff payroll data to verify CQC registration)
- Max claim = the published maximum (e.g., Oliver McGowan Tier 2 = £90/person)

#### 4. Receive Funding

- Reimbursement processed (typically 4–6 weeks)
- Funds returned to your organisation
- Evidence kept for audit

---

### Real Example: How LDSS Saves You Money

**Scenario:** A care home with 15 staff members wants to deliver Oliver McGowan Training (Tier 2) and provide leadership development for their registered manager.

**Cost breakdown (without LDSS):**
- Oliver McGowan Tier 2 (external delivery): 15 × £90 = £1,350
- "Preparing for CQC Assessment" (Skills for Care): 1 × £200 = £200
- **Total cost: £1,550**

**Cost with LDSS reimbursement:**
- Pay upfront: £1,550
- Claim back: (15 × £90) + (1 × £40) = £1,350 + £40 = **£1,390**
- **Your net cost: £160** (vs. £1,550 without LDSS)

**Savings: £1,390 (90% funded by government)**

---

### Important Notes on LDSS

1. **Funding allocation is different from WDF**
   - You're not allocated a lump sum anymore
   - You claim reimbursement after staff complete training
   - Ensure budget exists to pay upfront

2. **Eligibility list changes quarterly**
   - New courses added, some removed
   - Check gov.uk/LDSS before booking
   - Confirm with your training provider

3. **Reimbursement caps are strict**
   - Oliver McGowan Tier 2 = max £90 per person
   - If a provider charges £120, you only reclaim £90 (pay the difference)
   - Factor this into procurement decisions

4. **Awarding organisation must be approved**
   - Not all First Aid providers are LDSS-approved
   - Even LDSS courses must come from approved awarding orgs
   - Verify before committing

5. **Mandatory training still your responsibility**
   - LDSS funds some qualifications, *not* core mandatory training
   - First Aid, safeguarding awareness, moving & handling, health & safety = your budget
   - Don't assume everything is funded

---

### CTA and LDSS

At **Continuity Training Academy:**

- We deliver **Oliver McGowan Training (Tier 1 & 2)** – LDSS eligible
- We're **externally procured**, so your reimbursement rates apply (Tier 1 = £25, Tier 2 = £90)
- We're **CQC-compliant**, meeting all training quality standards
- We **provide documentation** (invoices, certificates, attendance records) for your LDSS claim
- We can discuss LDSS eligibility when you book

**We also deliver:**
- First Aid (EFAW, Paediatric) – not LDSS-funded, but essential
- Medication Competency – not LDSS-funded, but mandatory
- Moving & Handling, Safeguarding, etc. – not LDSS-funded, but CQC-required

These courses aren't cheaper via LDSS, but they're equally important.

---

### Maximising Your LDSS Budget

**Strategy:**
1. **Tier 2 Oliver McGowan first** – Highest reimbursement (£90/person), mandatory requirement
2. **Leadership qualifications next** – Skills for Care courses for managers (£40–200)
3. **Specialist qualifications** – Dementia, autism, mental health (£130–445, depending on level)
4. **Fund mandatory training separately** – Build this into operational budget (non-reimbursable)

**Planning tip:** Map out your year's training needs (January):
- How many staff need Oliver McGowan? (Likely all of them)
- Who needs leadership development? (Managers, senior carers)
- Which specialist areas matter for your service? (Dementia, learning disability, mental health)

### Conclusion: Use LDSS Strategically

LDSS is **better than WDF** because:
- Higher reimbursement rates (especially Oliver McGowan Tier 2)
- Clearer eligibility
- Simpler claims process
- Extended course list

**But remember:**
- Only specific courses are funded
- You still must fund mandatory training
- LDSS is reimbursement, not pre-funding
- Claims take 4–6 weeks

**Plan your training calendar around LDSS eligibility, and you'll maximise your budget while ensuring CQC compliance.**
