# Continuity Training Academy - FAQs

## General Training Questions

### 1. What training is mandatory for care workers?

Mandatory training is the essential foundation every care worker needs. At CTA, we ensure care workers complete:

- **Health and Safety Awareness** – Understanding workplace hazards and your responsibilities
- **Infection Prevention and Control** – Current practices for safe, hygienic care
- **Fire Safety** – Evacuating safely and protecting people in your care
- **Moving and Handling** – Safe techniques to protect yourself and those you support
- **Safeguarding Adults** – Recognising and reporting abuse or neglect
- **Learning Disability and Autism Awareness** (Oliver McGowan training) – Required by law since July 2022
- **Safeguarding Children** – Essential for roles involving contact with under-18s

For roles involving medication, **Medication Competency** is non-negotiable. All of these are CQC expectations, and gaps in mandatory training are red flags during inspection.

**CTA Reality Check:** Just because you've done the online module doesn't mean you're competent. Our hands-on approach ensures your team can actually *do* these things under pressure—not just pass a quiz.

---

### 2. How often does training need to be renewed?

The short answer: **Every three years minimum** for most mandatory training, unless the content is included in a recognised adult social care qualification within that three-year window.

However, some topics need refreshing sooner if:
- New risks are introduced (new equipment, new care tasks)
- Legislation changes (happens regularly in care)
- An incident or near-miss highlights gaps
- Individual competency assessments show decline

**Medication training** is more frequent—usually annual refreshers are expected because this is high-risk, high-compliance work.

**CTA Advice:** Don't wait until certificates expire. Build a renewal calendar now and book courses 2-3 months in advance—our courses fill up fast, and compliance deadlines sneak up.

---

### 3. What's the difference between CPD and accredited training?

**CPD (Continuing Professional Development)** is ongoing learning—it can be formal or informal, and it's flexible. Reading a safeguarding update article, shadowing a colleague on medication rounds, attending a webinar—that's all CPD.

**Accredited training** is formal, assessed learning leading to a recognised qualification or certificate. It's governed by awarding bodies like TQUK, NCFE CACHE, or HSE (for First Aid). Accredited courses have standards, quality checks, and carry more weight.

**Why it matters for you:** CQC expects *some* accredited training, but they also recognise CPD. A good training strategy mixes both—accredited courses for core mandatory training, CPD for specialisms and ongoing development.

**CTA Mix:** We deliver HSE-approved First Aid (accredited), CQC-compliant courses (accredited), *and* we support your CPD through coaching, on-site training tailored to your policies, and scenario-based learning.

---

### 4. Do online courses meet CQC requirements?

Short answer: **It depends, but CQC is increasingly sceptical about online-only training.**

The CQC Inspection Framework values *competence*. For practical, high-stakes care skills (First Aid, medication administration, moving and handling), online modules don't build muscle memory or real-world confidence. Staff can't practice CPR on a dummy via Zoom.

**For theory-heavy topics** (e.g., GDPR, understanding dementia), online can work *as part* of a blended approach. But even then, interaction and assessment matter.

**CQC Reality:** Inspectors ask, "Can your staff actually do this if a crisis happened?" Online certificates often can't answer that confidently.

**CTA Stance:** We're in-person, hands-on, and practical. No "click and certificate" shortcuts. Real people, real scenarios, real confidence.

---

### 5. What is the Care Certificate and who needs it?

The **Care Certificate** is a nationally recognised qualification covering 15 standards for adult social care workers. It's not legally mandatory, but it's a gold standard—hugely respected by employers, CQC, and Skills for Care.

**Who benefits most:**
- New care workers entering the industry
- Care assistants progressing toward team leader roles
- Anyone without formal social care qualifications
- Roles involving domiciliary or residential care

**What it covers:** Communication, person-centred care, duty of care, safeguarding, equality, health and safety, infection control, medication awareness, mental health, dementia, nutrition, hydration, privacy, and dignity.

**Reality:** The Care Certificate isn't *mandatory*, but if a CQC inspector sees staff without it and without equivalent qualifications, they ask why. It's the industry's signal of competence.

**CTA Offer:** We deliver Care Certificate-aligned training and can support your team's progression pathway.

---

### 6. How long are training certificates valid?

**Most certificates are valid for three years**, after which refresher training is required. This applies to:
- Safeguarding (all levels)
- Health and Safety
- Fire Safety
- Infection Control
- Learning Disability and Autism Awareness

**First Aid certificates (EFAW/Paediatric):** Valid for three years. After that, you need a refresher course (not a full retraining).

**Medication and moving/handling:** Often require annual refreshers or competency reassessment depending on your policy and the risks in your setting.

**Specialist certificates** (e.g., dementia, end-of-life care) vary by awarding body—typically 3–5 years.

**CQC Inspection Tip:** Inspectors will check your training evidence. Expired certificates are a compliance gap. Use our Training Renewal Tracker template to stay ahead.

---

### 7. What happens if training expires?

**Short answer: Your staff are no longer deemed competent for those duties, and you're in breach of CQC regulation.**

Practically, this means:
- That team member can't be rostered for duties requiring that training
- You have a compliance gap in your inspection file
- If an incident occurs and training is expired, liability falls on the organisation
- Insurance may not cover incidents involving untrained staff

**It's not a small issue.** CQC explicitly checks training records for expiry dates. If you have expired Fire Safety training but an evacuation was needed, that's a serious finding.

**CTA Prevention:** We help you build a training calendar and send renewal reminders. Spaces fill up—booking 2–3 months early keeps compliance on track.

---

### 8. Can training be completed during probation?

**Yes—and it should be.** In fact, mandatory training is *part* of a proper induction.

**Best practice:** Probation periods should include:
- **Weeks 1–2:** Emergency First Aid, Fire Safety, Health & Safety basics, safeguarding intro
- **Weeks 2–4:** Moving and handling, infection control, role-specific training
- **Weeks 4–8:** Deeper competency building, shadow rounds, assessments

**CQC Expectation:** Providers should evidence that staff are trained *before* they work unsupervised. Waiting until probation ends to train them is risky.

**CTA Approach:** We offer fast-track, intensive courses that fit probation timelines. New starters can complete core training within their first two weeks, building confidence and competence from day one.

---

## Booking & Scheduling

### 9. How do I book training for my team?

**Three easy ways to book with CTA:**

1. **Eventbrite (Individual or small groups)**
   - Visit our Eventbrite page, browse upcoming courses
   - Select date, number of delegates, and book online
   - Payment and confirmation immediate
   - Perfect for quick bookings

2. **Direct Phone**
   - Call **01622 587 343**
   - Speak to our team about your specific needs
   - Discuss group discounts, dates, on-site options
   - Fast-track booking for employers

3. **Bespoke Group Training (Best for care providers)**
   - Email **enquiries@continuitytrainingacademy.co.uk**
   - Discuss your team's training plan for the year
   - We tailor dates, venues, and course content
   - Often the most cost-effective for larger teams

**Pro tip:** Larger bookings (8+ delegates) get group discounts and flexible scheduling.

---

### 10. What's your cancellation policy?

**For individual bookings (Eventbrite):**
- **More than 14 days before the course:** Full refund
- **7–14 days before:** 75% refund
- **Less than 7 days:** No refund (we can sometimes offer place transfer)

**For group/bespoke training:**
- Cancellations made 30+ days in advance: Full refund (minus admin)
- 14–30 days: 50% refund
- Less than 14 days: No refund

**Delegate swaps (much easier):**
- Can't make the date? Swap your spot with another team member anytime, free of charge
- Just let us know in advance

**CTA Philosophy:** We build relationships, not rigid policies. If something's genuinely difficult, talk to us—we'll usually find a solution.

---

### 11. Can you deliver training at our location?

**Absolutely—this is one of our strengths.** We deliver on-site training at:
- Care homes
- Supported living services
- Domiciliary care provider offices
- Health services
- Nurseries and childcare

**Why on-site training works:**
- No travel time for your team
- Training tailored to *your* policies and environment
- Scenarios using your equipment, your settings, your processes
- More cost-effective for large teams (often cheaper than public courses)
- Flexible scheduling (evenings/weekends available)

**What we need:**
- Appropriate room (tables, chairs, privacy)
- Access to your equipment (mannequins for First Aid, moving equipment for M&H, etc.)
- 2–3 weeks' notice for booking

**CTA Mobile Reach:** We serve Maidstone, Kent, and the wider South East. No travel is too far—we come to you.

---

### 12. What are your group booking discounts?

**The more you book, the more you save:**

- **4–7 delegates:** 5% discount per person
- **8–15 delegates:** 10% discount per person
- **16–25 delegates:** 15% discount per person
- **25+ delegates:** Custom pricing—call for a quote

**Annual contracts (even better value):**
If you commit to regular training (e.g., quarterly refreshers, new starter inductions), we offer bespoke packages with deeper discounts.

**Example:** A care home with 20 staff doing quarterly mandatory updates could save £1,500–£2,000 annually through group pricing.

**CTA Reality:** Bulk training is our sweet spot. You get better pricing, we build a long-term relationship, and your compliance is sorted.

---

### 13. How far in advance should I book?

**Ideal timeline: 8–12 weeks before you need training.**

Here's why:
- **8–10 weeks:** Guarantees your preferred date and trainer
- **4–8 weeks:** Still good availability, but less flexibility
- **2–4 weeks:** Possible, but dates may be limited
- **Less than 2 weeks:** Only book if you're flexible on dates

**Seasonal peaks:** January, April, September, and November are busy (new year resolutions, inspection prep, team changes). Book early if you target these months.

**Emergency training:** Sometimes you need urgent refreshers (inspection notice, staff absence, incident). Call us—we'll do our best to squeeze you in, but can't promise preferred dates.

**CTA Tip:** Plan your year's training calendar now. Block out dates in January, April, September, and November. This keeps compliance on track and saves 20–30% through advance planning.

---

### 14. Do you offer weekend or evening training?

**Yes—we're flexible.**

**Evening courses (after 16:30):**
- Available by request for groups of 8+
- Perfect for teams with shift patterns
- Usually 1–2 nights depending on the course

**Weekend courses:**
- Saturday courses available (9 AM – 4 PM)
- Ideal for care homes with limited weekday staff availability
- Popular for roles requiring EFAW/Paeds before employment starts

**Book ahead:** Weekend and evening slots fill quickly. Give us 4–6 weeks' notice for these.

**Not every course suits evening/weekend:** Some hands-on courses (e.g., advanced moving and handling) work better during regular hours. We'll advise what's possible when you call.

---

### 15. What happens if staff can't attend on the day?

**If a delegate can't make it:**

1. **More than 7 days before:** Free transfer to another date (no charge, no refund)
2. **Less than 7 days:** Same policy applies (we operate on goodwill, not penalties)
3. **Last-minute emergency:** Contact us ASAP. We'll try to reschedule or find a replacement from your team

**Why we're flexible:** We know care is unpredictable. Unplanned absences happen. Swapping delegates is often the easiest solution.

**What we ask:** Just give us notice so we can update the register and ensure the right people are trained.

---

### 16. Can I change training dates after booking?

**Yes, with flexibility depending on timing:**

- **8+ weeks before:** Free date change, no questions
- **4–8 weeks before:** Free change if we have availability
- **2–4 weeks before:** Possible, but limited slots—ask first
- **Less than 2 weeks:** Difficult, but we'll try

**Delegate swaps:** Super easy. If Person A can't make 15 March but Person B can, just tell us. No charge.

**Group courses:** If you've booked a bespoke on-site course and need to reschedule, we'll work with your calendar. Usually 2–3 weeks' notice keeps things smooth.

**Bottom line:** We work around your needs. Life in care is busy—we get it.

---

## Certification & Accreditation

### 17. Are your courses CQC-compliant?

**Yes—100%.** Every course we deliver aligns with:
- **CQC Regulation 18** (Training requirements)
- **CQC Inspection Framework** (Key Lines of Enquiry for training and competence)
- **Skills for Care standards** (statutory and mandatory training guide)
- **HSE requirements** (for First Aid and Health & Safety courses)

**What this means practically:**
- Our content covers what CQC inspectors expect to see
- We provide evidence (certificates, attendance records, competency sign-offs)
- Our courses bridge the gap between "completed training" and "can actually do the job"
- If inspectors ask, "Can you evidence competence?"—we help you answer confidently

**CTA Commitment:** We don't just deliver courses. We help you build a training portfolio that stands up to CQC scrutiny.

---

### 18. What accreditations do you have?

**CTA holds:**

- **Advantage Accreditation** – Centre of the Year 2021
- **HSE Approval** – For Emergency First Aid at Work (Level 3)
- **CPD Accreditation** – All our courses are CPD-registered
- **Skills for Care alignment** – Our content matches their statutory and mandatory training standards
- **Ofsted compliance** – For childcare-related courses (Paediatric First Aid)

**Quality Assurance:**
- Trainers are industry-experienced (not just certified)
- Annual quality reviews and updates
- Feedback-driven course design
- Scenario-based, practical assessment

**CTA Transparency:** We're happy to share accreditation documents. Ask when you enquire.

---

### 19. Who accredits your certificates?

**Depends on the course:**

- **First Aid (EFAW/Paediatric):** HSE-approved via our accreditation body
- **Medication Competency:** CQC-compliant, Skills for Care-aligned assessment
- **Safeguarding, Moving & Handling, etc.:** CPD-accredited and Skills for Care-referenced
- **Care Certificate:** Aligned with Skills for Care standards (if relevant to your pathway)

**What this means:** Your certificates carry weight nationally. Employers, CQC, and other providers recognise them.

**Not a franchise course list?** No. We deliver tailored, CQC-compliant training. Certificates are evidence of *your* competence, assessed by *our* expert trainers in real-world scenarios.

---

### 20. Are your certificates accepted nationally?

**Yes.** Our certificates are:
- Recognised by CQC
- Accepted by employers across the UK
- Valid for roles in care homes, domiciliary care, nursing, supported living, and specialist services
- Transferable if staff move between employers

**The only exception:** Some roles (e.g., registered nurse, specific clinical roles) may require additional qualifications or registration. We'll advise on this during booking.

**Pro tip:** Your training records (ours + any others) build a portfolio showing ongoing competence development. This is gold for CQC and for staff morale.

---

### 21. Do you provide digital certificates?

**Yes—instant digital delivery after course completion.**

After your course ends:
- Digital certificate sent to your email same day (or next business day)
- PDF format—easy to print, share, or store
- Includes attendee name, course name, date, trainer name, and validity period
- Registrar's signature and CTA accreditation details

**Physical copies:** Available on request (small additional cost for postage).

**Storing certificates:** We recommend:
- Digital backup (secure shared drive)
- Staff personnel files
- Training management system (if you use one)

**CQC Inspection:** Have these ready. Inspectors will ask to see evidence. Digital + physical copies = fully prepared.

---

### 22. How quickly do we receive certificates?

**Typically within 24 hours of course completion.** 

For courses ending in the afternoon, digital certificates are sent by end of business.

For courses ending mid-day, you usually have them by email within 2 hours.

**Urgent timescales?** If you need evidence before a specific date (e.g., CQC inspection notice), let us know when booking. We can often expedite.

**No waiting games:** This is one advantage of in-person training—you know immediately if staff are competent, and you get proof fast.

---

### 23. What if a certificate is lost?

**No problem—we hold records.**

- Email us with attendee name and course date
- We'll provide a replacement digital certificate (free)
- Physical copy available if needed (small admin fee)
- Process usually takes 2–3 working days

**Backup strategy:** Keep digital copies of all certificates in a secure shared folder (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.). This prevents loss and makes CQC inspections stress-free.

---

### 24. Do your courses meet Skills for Care standards?

**Completely.** All our content aligns with:
- **Skills for Care Statutory and Mandatory Training Guide** (August 2024 update)
- **Care Certificate standards** (15 standards for adult social care workers)
- **Oliver McGowan Training on Learning Disability and Autism**
- **Leadership and management frameworks** (for manager-level courses)

**Why this matters:**
- If you're applying for **Workforce Development Fund (LDSS) grants**, our courses are eligible
- Staff trained with us have a recognised, national qualification
- CQC sees Skills for Care alignment as best practice

**CTA + Skills for Care:** We stay updated on changes and refresh our content annually. You're always current.

---

## Course-Specific Questions

### 25. What's included in the Care Certificate?

The **Care Certificate covers 15 standards:**

1. **Understanding your role** – Knowing your responsibilities and accountabilities
2. **Your health, safety and wellbeing** – Protecting yourself while at work
3. **Duty of care** – Understanding safeguarding and your legal obligations
4. **Equality and inclusion** – Treating people fairly and respecting diversity
5. **Working in a person-centred way** – Putting the individual at the centre
6. **Communication** – Listening, speaking, and understanding diverse needs
7. **Privacy and dignity** – Respecting confidentiality and personal space
8. **Fluids and nutrition** – Supporting healthy eating and drinking
9. **Awareness of mental health, dementia and learning disabilities**
10. **Safeguarding adults**
11. **Safeguarding children**
12. **Basic life support and First Aid**
13. **Health and safety in care settings**
14. **Handling information and keeping it confidential**
15. **Infection prevention and control**

**Format:** Mix of taught sessions, practice scenarios, and practical assessment.

**Time:** Usually 8–10 days (depending on delivery method).

**CTA Approach:** We deliver Care Certificate content in real-world scenarios using your setting. Staff leave not just "trained" but confident.

---

### 26. Which first aid course do childcare staff need?

**Childcare staff require: Emergency Paediatric First Aid (Level 3), OFSTED-approved.**

This covers:
- CPR on infants and children
- Choking (different techniques for kids)
- Common paediatric emergencies (febrile convulsions, allergic reactions, etc.)
- Recovery position for children
- Assessment and reassurance in a crisis

**Why separate from adult EFAW?**
Anatomy differs (tiny airways, different compression depths), and early childhood scenarios are unique.

**Both courses matter:**
Some roles (e.g., managers in nurseries) benefit from *both* Adult EFAW and Paediatric EFAW—for comprehensive coverage.

**CTA Delivery:** One-day, practical course. Small groups, lots of mannequin practice. Staff leave confident they could handle a real paediatric emergency.

**Regulatory note:** OFSTED expects evidence of Paediatric First Aid. It's not optional in childcare.

---

### 27. What's the difference between medication awareness and competency?

**Medication Awareness:**
- Understand what medications are, why people take them, side effects
- Know how to store and handle medications safely
- Understand why accurate records matter
- Can explain but not *administer*

**Medication Competency:**
- Can administer medications correctly (oral, topical, injected—depending on role)
- Understands the "5 Rights" (right person, drug, dose, route, time)
- Can assess when to withhold medication
- Assessed as *competent* by a trainer/assessor

**When Awareness enough?** Roles where staff handle meds but don't administer (e.g., care assistants, domiciliary support).

**When Competency needed?** Direct administration—care workers giving tablets, nurses giving injections, anyone signing off medication administration.

**CQC Reality:** Inspectors ask, "Who can administer medications?" Your answer must be specific and evidenced. Awareness ≠ Competency.

**CTA Approach:** We assess *actual* competence. No guessing on the day—we verify you can do it safely.

---

### 28. Do I need moving & handling theory AND practical?

**Yes—both are essential. They're not separate.**

**Theory (classroom):**
- Understanding biomechanics, spine health, loads
- Legislation (Health & Safety at Work Act, MHOR)
- Risk assessment approach
- Communication and consent

**Practical (hands-on):**
- Transferring using equipment (slide sheets, hoists, turntables)
- Manual handling techniques (where absolutely necessary)
- Adaptive methods for different conditions (stroke, arthritis, dementia)
- Real equipment your service uses

**Why both?** You can't safely move someone without understanding *why* you're doing it that way. Theory informs practice.

**Duration:** Usually 1–2 days depending on role complexity.

**CTA Difference:** We bring your actual equipment. Training happens in *your* care environment (if on-site), not a sterile classroom.

---

### 29. Is safeguarding training different for managers?

**Yes—significantly.**

**Safeguarding Level 1 (for all care workers):**
- Recognising signs of abuse/neglect
- Knowing who to report to
- Understanding your role
- Basic case scenarios

**Safeguarding Level 2 (for supervisory/team roles):**
- More detailed abuse types (including institutional, self-neglect)
- Recording and evidence gathering
- Supporting victims and witnesses
- Creating a safeguarding culture
- Policy and procedure implementation

**Safeguarding Level 3 (for managers/registered managers):**
- Safeguarding strategy and policy development
- Managing allegations
- Multi-agency working (police, social care investigations)
- Creating systems and oversight
- Legal responsibilities and accountability

**CQC Inspection:** Inspectors specifically check that managers have Level 2 or 3 evidence. If you don't, that's a compliance gap.

**CTA Delivery:** Role-specific, scenario-based. Managers leave with confidence in handling real safeguarding issues.

---

### 30. What level of dementia training do we need?

**Depends on your role and service type:**

**Level 1 (Awareness—for all staff):**
- What dementia is, types (Alzheimer's, vascular, etc.)
- Progression and symptoms
- Communicating with someone with dementia
- Reducing triggers for distress
- Basic person-centred approaches
- *Who needs it?* Everyone in care

**Level 2 (Principles—for care and supervisory roles):**
- Deeper understanding of dementia care
- Understanding behaviour as communication
- Environmental design for dementia support
- Working with families
- Managing complex behaviours
- *Who needs it?* Care workers, team leaders, activity coordinators

**Level 3 (Advanced—for managers, specialists):**
- Dementia care strategy
- Staff training and supervision
- Complex presentations (advanced dementia, co-morbidities)
- End-of-life care in dementia
- *Who needs it?* Registered managers, clinical leads

**CQC Expectation:** All staff should have at least Level 1. If your service specialises in dementia, Level 2+ is standard.

**CTA Reality:** Dementia care isn't a checkbox. It's a way of thinking. We train for genuine understanding, not just certificate collection.

---

## Payment & Funding

### 31. What payment methods do you accept?

**We accept:**
- Debit and credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- Bank transfer (BACS)
- Cheque (with advance notice)

**Eventbrite bookings:** Payment taken online (card only) at booking.

**Large group/invoice-based bookings:** Bank transfer often preferred. We'll invoice after confirming course details.

**No payment issues:** CTA is transparent on pricing. No hidden fees, no surprise charges.

**Payment timing:** Invoiced courses typically due within 30 days. Eventbrite bookings are immediate.

---

### 32. Do you offer payment plans?

**For larger group training commitments, yes.**

If you're investing in an annual training plan (e.g., quarterly mandatory updates for a care home), we can discuss:
- Staged payments across the year
- Deposit + final payment structure
- Monthly training packages with set costs

**Small individual courses:** Fixed pricing, payment upfront (Eventbrite) or via invoice.

**How to arrange:** Email **enquiries@continuitytrainingacademy.co.uk** with your training needs. We'll discuss options.

**CTA Philosophy:** We partner with you for the long term. If payment structure is the barrier, let's solve it.

---

### 33. Can we use Workforce Development Fund?

**Short answer: Yes, but it's now called LDSS (Learning and Development Support Scheme).**

**What changed:** The Workforce Development Fund (WDF) was replaced by the Adult Social Care Learning and Development Support Scheme (LDSS) from April 2025.

**How it works:**
1. Check the eligible course list on gov.uk (our courses are listed)
2. Book and pay for training upfront
3. Claim reimbursement from LDSS (up to the stated maximum per course)

**Eligible courses include:**
- The Oliver McGowan Training (Tier 1 & 2)
- Leadership and management programmes
- Specialist qualifications (dementia, autism, end-of-life care)
- Some diploma-level adult care qualifications

**What's NOT covered:** General awareness training, First Aid, moving & handling (unless part of a larger qualification).

**CTA Support:** When you book, tell us you're using LDSS. We'll provide invoices and documentation to support your claim.

**Important:** Check the eligible course list and reimbursement rates annually. LDSS changes quarterly.

---

### 34. Do you provide training invoices for our records?

**Absolutely.** We provide:
- Itemised invoices (course name, date, attendee list, cost)
- Attendance certificates for all participants
- Training records showing competency sign-off
- Digital copies of all documents

**Invoice timing:** Sent within 2 working days of course completion.

**For LDSS claims:** We provide all documentation needed to submit your reimbursement claim.

**Compliance ready:** Everything is formatted for audit and CQC inspection.

---

### 35. Are there discounts for multiple courses?

**Yes—our group discount structure includes volume savings:**

- **Single course, 4–7 people:** 5% per person
- **Single course, 8–15 people:** 10% per person
- **Single course, 16+ people:** 15% per person

**Multiple courses over a year?** Even better. Annual packages typically offer 15–20% savings compared to ad-hoc bookings.

**Example:** A care home booking quarterly mandatory refreshers for 15 staff across the year might save £2,500–£3,500 through multi-course pricing.

**How to arrange:** Email **enquiries@continuitytrainingacademy.co.uk** with your annual training plan. We'll quote a bespoke package.

---

### 36. Can we pay per delegate or per course?

**Both options available, depending on structure:**

**Per delegate (most common for groups):**
- You pay for each person attending
- Useful if team numbers fluctuate
- Example: £150 per person × 10 people = £1,500

**Per course (block booking):**
- You book a course for a specific date
- One price, regardless of final headcount (within limits)
- Useful for annual planning
- Example: Full Emergency First Aid course (12 spaces) = £1,200 total

**Flexible approach:** If some staff might not attend, per-delegate pricing reduces financial risk. If you're certain of headcount, per-course is often cheaper.

**When booking:** We'll ask about your preference and recommend the most cost-effective option.

---

## Group Training & Employers

### 37. What's the minimum group size for on-site training?

**Minimum: 6 people** for on-site courses (to make travel worthwhile for our trainer).

**Smaller groups (1–5 people):** Can usually attend a public course instead, often at similar or better cost.

**Larger groups (8–25 people):** Often more cost-effective on-site with group discounts.

**Example pricing:**
- 1–3 people: Public course (e.g., £150 per person)
- 6–8 people: On-site training often cheaper per head
- 15+ people: Significant on-site discount vs. public courses

**Talk to us:** If you have 4–5 people, email **enquiries@continuitytrainingacademy.co.uk**. We might combine them with another organisation's group or suggest public course dates.

---

### 38. Can you tailor training to our policies?

**Completely—that's what we do.**

When we deliver on-site training, we:
- Review your policies and procedures beforehand
- Tailor scenarios to your care environment
- Use your equipment (hoists, moving aids, medication charts)
- Address your specific risks and challenges
- Train your staff in *your* context, not generic care theory

**Examples:**
- A domiciliary care agency: We focus on home safety, lone working, medication in non-clinical settings
- A care home: We include your facilities, your resident needs, your escalation procedures
- A nursing home: We address clinical protocols, medication administration, delegation

**CQC Reality:** Inspectors often ask, "Is your training tailored to your service?" Bespoke training shows yes.

**CTA Commitment:** No off-the-shelf courses. Your training, your setting, your standards.

---

### 39. Do you provide training matrices for your staff?

**Yes—in multiple formats:**

**What we provide:**
- Role-based training matrices (care worker, team leader, manager, clinical staff, specialists)
- Mapped against CQC Key Lines of Enquiry
- Showing mandatory, recommended, and specialist training
- Frequency and refresher timelines
- Eligibility criteria for each role

**Formats:**
- Excel (editable—you can adapt to your specific structure)
- PDF (for sharing with staff, managers)
- Printable or digital storage

**How it works:**
You use the matrix to plan training for each team member, identify gaps, and schedule refreshers. It becomes your annual training plan.

**CTA Support:** We help populate the matrix during your first year, then you own it.

---

### 40. Can you track training for multiple sites?

**For group training contracts, yes.**

If you operate multiple care homes, domiciliary services, or nursing facilities, we:
- Maintain separate attendance and competency records per site
- Provide aggregate reports showing compliance across all locations
- Help you identify organisation-wide training gaps
- Support your quality assurance and CQC preparation

**How it works:**
- Provide us with a list of sites and roles
- We schedule training across all locations
- We send site-specific and consolidated reports
- You have a complete training audit trail

**Size:** Works well for organisations with 2–5 locations.

### 41. Do you offer annual training contracts?

**Yes—our preferred model for care providers.**

An **annual training contract** typically includes:
- Quarterly mandatory refreshers for all staff
- New starter induction training
- Role-specific development (team leader, manager, clinical)
- Specialist courses (dementia, end-of-life, safeguarding advanced)
- On-site delivery where possible
- Priority booking and reserved dates
- Discounted rates (15–25% vs. ad-hoc)
- Annual training calendar and planning support

**Cost:** Usually £3,000–£8,000 annually depending on staff size and course mix.

**Benefit:** Compliance is sorted. You're not scrambling to book last-minute courses or facing expired certificates.

**How to arrange:**
1. Email **enquiries@continuitytrainingacademy.co.uk** 
2. Describe your team size, roles, and compliance needs
3. We'll build a bespoke annual plan and quote

**CTA Reality:** This is where we excel—long-term partnerships, strategic training planning, embedded quality.

### 42. Can trainers visit multiple locations?

**Absolutely—we're mobile.**

If you operate multiple sites across Kent and the South East:
- Our trainer can visit Site A, Site B, Site C on consecutive days
- Cost-effective (one trainer deployment vs. three separate bookings)
- Consistent messaging across locations
- Easier compliance tracking

**What we need:**
- 2–3 weeks' notice for a multi-site tour
- Clear list of dates, locations, and participant numbers
- Appropriate training space at each location
- Same course (easier to coordinate) or closely related courses

**Example:** A domiciliary care provider with 3 office locations books Emergency First Aid at all three on Mon/Tues/Weds. One trainer, one week, significant savings.

**Logistics:** We handle travel. You just confirm locations and dates.

**CTA Advantage:** Mobile, flexible, organised. Your training fits your geography, not the other way around.
