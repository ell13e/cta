### EFAW: Emergency First Aid at Work (Detailed)

#### What It Covers

**Primary skills:**
- **CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)** on adults – chest compressions at 100–120 beats/min, rescue breaths, recovery position
- **Choking** – recognising choking, back blows, abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre), positioning
- **Severe bleeding** – tourniquet application, pressure dressings, shock management
- **Unconsciousness** – recovery position, airway management, when to call emergency services
- **Common emergencies** – chest pain (suspected heart attack), stroke, seizures, severe allergic reaction
- **AED use** – automated external defibrillator operation and positioning
- **Head/spinal injury** – recognising and managing without movement

#### Scenario-Based Learning

CTA's EFAW course uses real-world care scenarios:
- "A resident collapses during lunch—what do you do first?"
- "You find someone unresponsive in the bathroom—are they breathing?"
- "A resident is choking—do you use back blows or abdominal thrusts?"
- "Someone has severe bleeding from a fall—how do you stop it?"

Each scenario involves live practice with mannequins, AED training, and immediate feedback.

#### CQC Requirement

CQC **does not mandate** First Aid specifically in its Inspection Framework. However:
- It's in the **Care Certificate standards** (Standard 12: Basic life support and First Aid)
- It's listed as a recommended course for care workers
- If an incident occurs and staff lack First Aid, it becomes a compliance concern
- Many care contracts include EFAW as a requirement

**CQC Reality:** Inspectors ask, "Do your staff have First Aid training?" If you say no, they note it. If you say yes, they verify via certificates. It's not a red flag alone, but it's expected evidence of care quality.

#### Who Should Have It

✅ **Must have EFAW:**
- Care home staff (all levels)
- Domiciliary care workers
- Nursing home staff
- Residential support workers
- Community care managers
- Day centre staff
- Anyone working unsupervised with vulnerable people

❓ **Should consider EFAW:**
- Administrators and office staff (in case of on-site emergency)
- Managers (to demonstrate organisational commitment)
- Family carers (to protect loved ones at home)

---

### Paediatric First Aid (Detailed)

#### What It Covers

**Infant-specific skills (newborn–12 months):**
- **Infant CPR** – one-handed chest compressions (using 2 fingers or heel of hand), reduced compression depth
- **Infant airway positioning** – keeping neutral to prevent obstruction (very different from adult head-tilt)
- **Choking in infants** – back blows, chest thrusts (never abdominal thrusts, which can rupture organs)
- **SIDS risk awareness** – sleep position, temperature, feeding recognition

**Child-specific skills (1–16 years):**
- **Child CPR** – hand position variations by age, appropriate compression depth
- **Child choking** – back blows, abdominal thrusts (now safe, unlike infants)
- **Febrile convulsions** – recognising fever-triggered seizures, management
- **Asthma and allergies** – recognising attacks, positioning, when to use inhalers/EpiPens
- **Poisoning/ingestion** – recognising common household toxins, first response
- **Fractures and sprains** – appropriate immobilisation for children
- **Paediatric shock** – managing shock in children (different vital signs than adults)

#### Why Paediatric Is Different

The human body changes dramatically birth to adulthood. CPR techniques, airway anatomy, medication doses—everything varies:

| Factor | Infant | Child (1–12) | Teenager (13+) |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Airway anatomy** | Narrowest at cricoid ring | Funnel-shaped larynx | Adult-like by 12 |
| **CPR hand position** | 2 fingers (sternum) | Heel of one hand | Two hands (if large) |
| **Compression depth** | ~4cm | ~5cm | ~5–6cm |
| **Breathing rate** | 40–60 breaths/min | 20–30 breaths/min | 12–20 breaths/min |
| **Heart rate** | 100–160 bpm | 70–140 bpm | 60–100 bpm |
| **AED use** | Attenuated (reduced) pads | Child-sized pads | Adult pads |

**Why this matters:** If you use adult CPR technique on an infant, you risk rib fractures, internal injuries, or airway damage. Paediatric training teaches age-appropriate responses.

#### CQC Requirement

**For childcare/early years:**
- **OFSTED requires** Paediatric First Aid (Level 3) for all staff
- Specifically: HSE-approved, one-day course
- **Validity:** 3 years (some settings require refreshers every 2 years for added safety)
- **Non-compliance:** If staff lack current Paediatric First Aid, OFSTED can rate you Inadequate on Safety grounds

**For other settings:** If your service involves contact with children (e.g., community support, family visiting), Paediatric training is strongly recommended.

### Cost and Accessibility

**Standard rates:**
- EFAW: £120–150 per person (HSE-approved providers)
- Paediatric: £120–150 per person (OFSTED-compliant providers)
- Both courses: £220–280 combined (book separately, same week for efficiency)

**Funding:** Neither course is covered by LDSS (Workforce Development Fund replacement). Budget from operational training costs.

**CTA rates:**
- EFAW: £140 per person (public course) or £150 on-site (8+ delegates)
- Paediatric: £140 per person (public course) or £150 on-site (8+ delegates)
- Discount: Book both = £260 per person (vs. £280 separately)

---

### Common Questions

**Q: Can one course cover both adults and children?**  
A: No. Adult CPR on a child can cause injury. Children's CPR differs anatomically. You need both if your role spans ages.

**Q: Do I need annual refreshers?**  
A: Certificates are valid 3 years. However, many care providers do annual refreshers because First Aid skills degrade. CQC isn't strict about this, but it shows commitment to safety.

**Q: What if I'm trained in Adult CPR but need to help a child?**  
A: In an emergency, do what you've been trained for. But ideally, you should have Paediatric training *before* a crisis. That's why both courses exist.

**Q: Is online First Aid training acceptable?**  
A: No. CQC and HSE require in-person, hands-on practice. Online courses don't teach physical skills. This is non-negotiable.

---

### CQC Reality Check

**CQC inspectors specifically check:**

1. **All staff have L1?** Yes/No → If No = compliance concern
2. **Supervisors have L2?** Yes/No → If No = expected finding (minor concern)
3. **Registered Manager has L3?** Yes/No → If No = serious concern
4. **Certificates current?** Yes/No → If No = red flag (may mean non-compliance)
5. **Evidence of competence beyond certificate?** (e.g., case handling, supervision records) → Shows actual capability, not just training completion

**CQC question to staff:** "Can you describe what you'd do if you suspected abuse?" 
- Care assistant (L1): Should be able to recognise signs and name the person to report to
- Team leader (L2): Should describe reporting, documenting, and immediate support steps
- Manager (L3): Should discuss strategy, multi-agency coordination, and organisational oversight

---

### How to Plan Your Team's Safeguarding Training

**Step 1: Map your roles**
- How many care assistants? → All need L1
- How many team leaders/supervisors? → Need L2
- How many registered managers? → Need L3

**Step 2: Check currency**
- When did each staff member last complete safeguarding training?
- Are any certificates about to expire?
- Have any staff been promoted (L1→L2 or L2→L3)?

**Step 3: Plan bookings**
- L1 refreshers: Bulk book annually or half-yearly
- L2: Booking for new supervisors or refreshers
- L3: Advanced booking for registered managers (limit 1–2 per year unless managing growth)

**Step 4: Budget**
- L1 (all staff): £30–60 × number of staff
- L2 (supervisory tier): £80–120 × number of supervisors
- L3 (registered managers): £150–250 × number of managers

---

### CTA's Approach
